# Modifications #
1. Change ball speed using the slide switches on the Nexys A7-100T board to program the ball speed in the range of 1-32 pixels per frame
2. Bat width decreases one pixel each time successfully hitting the ball and then resets to starting width when missing the ball (In this example making the bat decrease by 3 pixels each time to see the change quicker)
3. Count the number of successful hits after each serve and display the count in binary on the 7-segment displays of the Nexys A7-100T board
